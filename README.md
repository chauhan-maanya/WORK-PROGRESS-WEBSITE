## Why This Project Matters
This project reflects my ability to translate a real-world problem—task overload—into a lightweight, accessible digital solution. By focusing on instant usability and minimal design, I aimed to reduce cognitive load and encourage consistent task tracking. It also gave me insight into how small design decisions—like removing a login step—can drastically improve user engagement and satisfaction.

## Personal Contribution & Reflection

Although this was a group project, I independently designed and developed the complete core functionality of the website—from structuring the HTML to implementing JavaScript-driven task logic. I also led the UI/UX decisions to ensure a clean, accessible, and intuitive experience. This experience deepened my confidence in translating ideas into fully functional browser-based applications, and taught me how to balance individual ownership within collaborative work.
